    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a way to measure how efficient an algorithm is based on the amount of time it takes to run as the input size increases.

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm, and in many cases it can be expressed as O(n).
